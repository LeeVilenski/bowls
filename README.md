# Strength Tracker

A personal training dashboard that connects to your Strava account and tracks your strength sessions alongside your running. Log sets, reps and weight, track muscle group XP levels, and see how your training balance looks over time.

---

## What you'll need

- A free [GitHub](https://github.com) account
- A free [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account (this is where the app runs)
- A [Strava](https://www.strava.com) account
- An [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com) API key (optional — only needed for the AI coach feature)

The whole setup takes about 20–30 minutes. You don't need to install anything on your computer.

---

## Step 1 — Fork this repository

Forking makes your own personal copy of the code that you can deploy independently.

1. Make sure you're signed into GitHub
2. Click the **Fork** button at the top right of this page
3. Click **Create fork**

You now have your own copy at `github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Eds-Strength-Tracker`.

---

## Step 2 — Create a Strava API app

This gives the tracker permission to read your Strava data.

1. Go to [strava.com/settings/api](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Application Name**: anything you like, e.g. "My Strength Tracker"
   - **Category**: choose any
   - **Club**: leave blank
   - **Website**: put `https://example.com` for now
   - **Authorization Callback Domain**: put `localhost` for now — you'll update this later
3. Click **Save** and agree to the terms
4. You'll see your **Client ID** (a short number) and **Client Secret** (a long string) — keep this page open, you'll need both shortly

---

## Step 3 — Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up / sign in (you can use your GitHub account)
2. Click **Add New Project**
3. Click **Import** next to your forked `Eds-Strength-Tracker` repository
   - If you don't see it, click **Adjust GitHub App Permissions** and grant Vercel access to it
4. Leave all the settings as they are and click **Deploy**
5. Wait about a minute for it to finish building
6. Once done, click **Continue to Dashboard** — you'll see your app's URL at the top (something like `https://eds-strength-tracker-abc.vercel.app`). **Copy this URL.**

---

## Step 4 — Add a database

1. In your Vercel project dashboard, click the **Storage** tab
2. Click **Create Database**
3. Choose **Neon Serverless Postgres** and click **Continue**
4. Leave the defaults and click **Create**
5. Vercel will connect the database to your project automatically — no extra steps needed

---

## Step 5 — Add your environment variables

These are the secret keys that let your app talk to Strava, the database, and optionally the AI coach.

1. In your Vercel project, go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
2. Add each of the following by typing the name in the **Key** field and the value in the **Value** field, then clicking **Save**:

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID` | The Client ID number from Step 2 |
| `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET` | The Client Secret from Step 2 |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Your Vercel URL from Step 3, e.g. `https://eds-strength-tracker-abc.vercel.app` — no trailing slash |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | From [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) — optional, skip if you don't want the AI coach |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | A random secret used to sign sign-in sessions. Generate one with `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"` and paste the output here. |

> **Important:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` must exactly match your Vercel URL — copy and paste it rather than typing it.

---

## Step 6 — Redeploy

After adding environment variables you need to redeploy so the app picks them up.

1. Go to the **Deployments** tab in your Vercel project
2. Click the three dots **...** next to the most recent deployment
3. Click **Redeploy** → **Redeploy**
4. Wait for it to finish

---

## Step 7 — Update your Strava callback URL

Now that you have a live URL, you need to tell Strava about it.

1. Go back to [strava.com/settings/api](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)
2. Find **Authorization Callback Domain** and replace `localhost` with your Vercel domain — just the domain part, no `https://`, no trailing slash
   - e.g. `eds-strength-tracker-abc.vercel.app`
3. Save

---

## Step 8 — Set up the database tables

Visit this URL in your browser (replace with your own URL):

```
https://your-app.vercel.app/api/setup
```

You should see: `{"ok":true,"message":"Database tables created."}`

If you see an error, wait 30 seconds and try again — the database sometimes takes a moment to wake up on first use.

---

## Step 9 — Connect your Strava account

1. Visit your app URL
2. Click **Connect with Strava**
3. Authorise the app
4. You'll be redirected back and your activities will start loading

The first load may take 10–20 seconds as it pulls your full Strava history. After that it caches everything locally so it loads quickly.

Anyone you share the app URL with can do the same — each person clicks **Connect with Strava** and signs in with their own account, and only ever sees their own data. There's no separate account system to set up.

---

## Personalising the app

The app is named "Strength Tracker" by default — since everyone signs in with their own Strava account, this name is shared across everyone using your deployment. If you'd like to rename it (e.g. to a group name):

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub
2. Open `pages/index.js`
3. Click the pencil ✏️ icon to edit
4. Press **Ctrl+F** (or **Cmd+F** on Mac) and search for `Strength Tracker`
5. Replace the occurrences in the page title and header with your own name
6. Scroll down and click **Commit changes**

Vercel will automatically redeploy when you save changes on GitHub.

If you want the installed app/APK to show your new name too, also update `name` and `short_name` in `public/manifest.json` and `apple-mobile-web-app-title` in `pages/_document.js`. To change the app icon, edit `scripts/icon-source.svg` and regenerate the PNGs with `npm install sharp --no-save && node scripts/gen-icons.js`.

## How to record strength sessions

### Recording on your watch

For your sessions to appear in the tracker automatically, record them on your Garmin/Forerunner as one of these activity types:

- **Workout**
- **Strength Training**
- **Weight Training**
- **CrossFit**
- **HIIT**

Once the activity syncs to Strava, it will appear automatically in the app. Tap **+ add exercise breakdown** on the session to log your sets, reps and weight — this also writes the breakdown into that activity's Strava description.

### Logging a session manually

For sessions you didn't record on your watch (or don't want on your Strava feed), use the **+ Log Session** button in the Strength tab. You can give it a name, date, duration (minutes:seconds), and add an exercise breakdown the same way as a synced session.

### Adding heart rate data

Manually logged sessions can include heart rate data in two ways:

- **Type it in** — fill in the optional **Avg HR** / **Max HR** fields yourself.
- **Import from your watch** — if you recorded the session on your Garmin (even as a plain "Workout" you don't want on Strava), export the `.fit` file from [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com) (Activity → ⚙️ → Export Original) and upload it with **Import from watch (.fit)**. This automatically fills in average/max HR, duration, and calories, and stores the full HR stream so it can be shown on Strava as a heart rate graph.

### Pushing a manual session to Strava

If a manually logged session has an exercise breakdown and/or imported HR data, you can tap **Push to Strava** on it to create a real Strava activity for it. This builds a `.fit` file containing your sets (reps/weight per exercise) and, if you imported one, the full heart rate stream — so the Strava activity shows both the Strength Training set breakdown and an HR graph. Once pushed, the session is linked to its new Strava activity and won't be duplicated.

### Removing old sessions

- **Manual sessions** that haven't been pushed to Strava can be deleted with the **delete** link.
- **Synced sessions** that you've since deleted on Strava directly can be cleaned out of the app's cache with the **remove** link, so they stop cluttering your stats.

## A note on Strava's API rate limits

Strava limits each app to **200 requests every 15 minutes, and 2,000 per day**. Most of the app only needs one request per page load (thanks to the local cache), but a couple of features make extra calls and are worth knowing about:

- **Run distance "best efforts" (5K, 10K, Half Marathon, etc.)** — to show your true fastest splits (e.g. your fastest 5K *within* a longer run), the app has to fetch full activity details from Strava one run at a time and cache the results. This runs gradually in the background:
  - A couple of runs are processed on each normal page load
  - A few more are processed every ~10 seconds while you have a distance bucket expanded on the Runs tab
  - If you have a long Strava history, it can take a while (potentially hours of normal usage) for every run to be indexed. Until a run is indexed, that bucket falls back to ranking by overall pace instead of split times.
- **Pushing manual sessions / renaming activities** — each of these is a one-off action and uses only a handful of requests.

If you ever hit the rate limit (e.g. by repeatedly hammering **⟳ Sync Strava** or leaving many distance buckets open at once), Strava will start returning errors for a little while. The app is designed to fail quietly when this happens — the best-efforts backfill simply stops and picks up again on your next visit, and the "Indexing N more runs…" counter will just take longer to reach zero. You don't need to do anything; just wait 15 minutes and it'll recover on its own.

## Installing as an app, and building an Android APK

The site is a Progressive Web App (PWA), so it can be "installed" without any app store:

- **Android (Chrome)**: open the site, tap the menu (⋮) → **Add to Home screen** / **Install app**.
- **iOS (Safari)**: tap the Share icon → **Add to Home Screen**.
- **Desktop (Chrome/Edge)**: click the install icon (⊕) in the address bar.

This gives you a standalone window with its own icon and no browser address bar, and it always loads your live Vercel URL — so any future change you push to the web app shows up there too, with no extra steps.

### Building a real `.apk` (optional)

If you'd like an actual Android app file (e.g. to sideload, or to publish on the Play Store), use [PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com):

1. Make sure your app is deployed and the manifest/icons/service worker are live (they're already set up — `public/manifest.json`, `public/sw.js`, `public/icons/`).
2. Go to **pwabuilder.com** and enter your Vercel app URL.
3. PWABuilder analyses the site (it should score well, since the manifest, icons, and service worker are already in place) and lets you **Package for stores** → **Android**.
4. This downloads a ready-to-build Android project (or a signed `.apk`/`.aab`) that's just a wrapper loading your live site — there's nothing to keep in sync, since it always shows your deployed Vercel URL.
5. **Optional — remove the browser address bar for a fully "native" look:** PWABuilder will generate a signing key and an `assetlinks.json` snippet containing its SHA256 fingerprint. Save that snippet as `public/.well-known/assetlinks.json` in your repo, commit and push (Vercel will redeploy automatically). This proves to Android that your app and your website are the same thing, so the APK opens full-screen with no URL bar. Without this step, the APK still works fine — it just shows a minimal browser bar at the top.
6. Install the generated `.apk` on your Android device (transfer the file and open it, enabling "install unknown apps" if prompted), or upload the `.aab` to the Play Console if you want to distribute it via the Play Store.

Because the APK just loads your Vercel URL, any change you make to the web app (new features, layout tweaks, etc.) automatically applies to the APK too — you only need to repeat the PWABuilder steps if you change the app's **name** or **icon**, since those are baked into the APK itself.

## Troubleshooting

**"token_exchange_failed" when connecting Strava**
Check that `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID` and `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET` are correct in Vercel, and that `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` matches your exact Vercel URL. Try deleting and re-adding the variables, then redeploy.

**The app loads but shows no activities**
Try clicking the **⟳ Sync Strava** button in the top right corner of the app.

**Database errors on `/api/setup`**
Wait a minute and try again. If it still fails, check the Vercel dashboard → Logs tab for the specific error message.

**I made a change on GitHub but the app hasn't updated**
Vercel should redeploy automatically. Check the Deployments tab — if the latest build shows an error, click it to see what went wrong.

**A distance bucket on the Runs tab still shows "Indexing N more runs…" / rankings look off**
This is normal for accounts with a lot of history — see [A note on Strava's API rate limits](#a-note-on-stravas-api-rate-limits) above. The list will keep filling in over time as you use the app; no action needed.
